gist Plugin for DokuWiki

Creates a tag for embedding gists in dokuwiki pages.

Usage: [gist user/id] (the user and id can be found from the gist URL, e.g.:
https://gist.github.com/user/id )

WARNING: This plugin takes user input and inserts it into a <script> tag. While
user input is sanitized (using htmlentities and htmlspecialchars), it may still 
be possible for a nefarious user to exploit this code in a production environment. 
This plugin should probably not be used with non-trusted/anonymous users. 

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/alexbaden/embed-gist-dokuwiki

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/gist/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
